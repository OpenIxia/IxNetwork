# Name           : test.9.1.15_SVAPI_layer23TrafficFlowDetective.tcl
# Purpose        :
# Topology       : Create a configuration with 3-4 traffic items with multiple tracking.
#                  For example 1st traffic item track by SRC and Dst IP,
#                  2 nd one on SRC iP, Qos etc.Apply and Start traffic.
# Verification   : 1. Emulate All  flow based on selected stat/Best Performer
#                  2. Emulate All Live flow based on selected stat/Best Performer
#                  3. Emulate All dead flow based on selected stat/Best Performer
#                  4. Check no dead flow before stopping traffic
#                  5. Check no live flow after stoping traffic
#                  6. Check All Flow coming even after traffic stop
