Description
-----------
    A command line interface in a Python shell that allows you to configure or modify IxNetwork
    traffic item configurations, start and verify protocols, start traffic and getting stats.


Disclaimer
----------
    This application is not meant to support all IxNetwork features.  It's meant for lightweight 
    configurations designed for manufacturing and chip makers.

    However, you could create a very complicated configuration in the GUI, save the
    configuration into a file, and have this app load the saved config, startProtocols, verify all
    protocols including ARP, start/stop traffic and get stats, but this app will not be able to
    modify your configurations other than traffic items.  You could modify traffic streams such as
    frame size, frame rate, continuous traffic or fixed packet count, biDirectional and enable/disable
    traffic items.

         - Linux API server usage

Overview
--------
   - This is an IxNetwork ReST API application that emulates a CLI in a Python shell.
   - It is written in Python 3. Will work in Python 2.7 also.
   - This is intended for environments that configures simple configurations,
     send traffic and get stats.
   - This app allow users to use the CLI to make a configuration, modify traffic
     configurations, run and rerun traffic and get stats. 
   - All users have to do is enter the Python shell and enter "from ixnetCli import *" and 
     start entering CLI commands by calling function names.
   - The CLI commands are nothing but Python functions.
   - The Python functions are high level wrappers that calls functions in the the IxNetRestApi* modules.


Python and Feature support
--------------------------
   - This app supports Python 2.7 and Python 3+
   - Runs in both Linux and Windows based Ixia chassis.


Requirements
------------
   - IxNetwork version 8.40 (minimum)

   - One of the following IxNetwork API servers:
        - Windows
        - Linux
        - Windows Connection Manager is not supported at this time.

   - Python "requests" module

   - IxNetwork API modules:
       - ixnetCli.py

     In the directory, ../../Modules
       - IxNetRestApi.py
       - IxNetRestApiPortMgmt.py
       - IxNetRestApiFileMgmt.py
       - IxNetRestApiProtocolMgmt.py
       - IxNetRestApiTrafficMgmt.py
       - IxNetRestApiStatisticsMgmt.py
       - IxNetRestApiPortMgmt.py


    How to install the Python requests module
    ------------------------------------------

        - The requests module is a client-side tool to send ReST API commands.

        - If you are using Python version 2.7.9 to 2.7.14, you could do a "pip install requests".
            - If you're in a Linux environment, enter "which python" to get the path to your Python. 
            - If your Python path is: /usr/local/python2.7.9, then go to /usr/local/python2.7.9/bin and ...
            - Enter: sudo pip install requests 
            - Must have root privileges.

        - If you are using Python version 3+, follow the same steps as above.

        - If you are using Python version 2 prior to 2.7.9, make sure that you have pip installed. 
            - The earlier Python 2 versions don't come with PIP.
    	    - If you don't have PIP installed, then following the below steps to install it.
    	    - You must have root privilegs.
      
	    <Steps to install setuptools and install PIP>

	      In Linux:

	        - Enter: wget --no-check-certificate https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/s/setuptools/setuptools-8.2.1.tar.gz 
		- Enter: tar -xvf setuptools-8.2.1.tar.gz
		- Enter: cd setuptools-8.2.1
		- Enter: python setup.py install


    Where to get the IxNetRestApi modules
    --------------------------------------
       - Download/clone from Github:  https://github.com/IxNetwork
       - The full path to this application is: IxNetwork/RestApi/Python/Utilities/IxNetCli

    IxNetCli directory structure
    ----------------------------
        /IxNetwork/RestApi/Python/Utilities/IxNetCli
                  /Preferences
                  /ConfigFiles

Getting Started:
-----------------------
    Get the Python client-libraries and application.

    1> Clone from Github:  https://github.com/OpenIxia/IxNetwork.git

    2> Create a preference file in the /Preferences directory 

       Copy template.py to a meaningful name.  This is your preference file.
       You will set this preference file each time you use this app.

       IMPORTTANT:
          Copy the preference.py file to a different name and place it somewhere outside of your 
          cloned Github directory.  So in case you do an update from Github on this project, your 
          preference file will not get overwritten.

	This is where you state your preferred chassis IP, port list, API server IP and license server IP 
	so you don't have to enter them on CLI each time you run this application.

	Each user could have their own preference file because they could
	be using different chassis, ports, session ID, etc.

	How to tell IxnetCli to use which preference file:

	      Enter:  setpreferences('<preference>.py')


	- Preference file must have the .py extension.
        
	- Prefence files need to be stored in /Preferences.
          You could put them in other locations, then you must include the path to PYTHONPATH so
          IxNetCli knows where to import it from.

        
	Preference file example:
	
	  NOTE: Set the value to None if not applied.

            apiServerType = 'windows' ;# Options: windows|linux
            windowsApiServerIp = '192.168.70.3'
            windowsApiServerIpPort = 11009
            linuxApiServerIp = '192.168.70.9'
            linuxApiServerIpPort = 443
            apiKey = None
            username = 'admin'
            password = 'admin'
            licenseServerIp = '192.168.70.3'
            licenseMode = 'subscription'
            forceTakePortOwnership = True
            deleteSessionAfterTest = False ;# For Linux only
            enableDebugTracing = False ;# Display error tracebacks 

2 configuration methods
-----------------------
    1> Create a configuration from scratch
    2> Load a saved JSON or .ixncfg config file

    1> Create a configuration from scratch
       -----------------------------------
        - Currently, as of this writing, there is only a L2L3, BGP, MPLS templates available to create from scratch.
	- Enter: config("<bgpParams.py>").
	         For example: If you created a config file called bgpParams.py, then enter:
                              config('bgpParams.py')
		 
        - Reads the bgpParams.py parameter file, which is a Python dict file.
        - Configures two Topology.
        - Start all protocols.
        - Verifies ARP and protocols.

    2> Loading a saved config file
       -----------------------------
           - On the IxNetwork GUI, make sure your configuration is good.
	   - Export the configuration into either a JSON format file or a binary .ixncfg file.
	   - Put all saved config files in the /ConfigFiles directory.
	   - Enter: loadsavedconfig('ConfigFiles/<the saved config file>') 


2 IxNetwork API servers to use
------------------------------
Choices are:  Windows and Linux
	
    1> Windows
        - The Windows IxNetwork GUI is the ReST API server. Using tcp port 11009.
	- Supports only 1 session.

    2> Linux
        - Supports up to 10 concurrent sessions.

        - The Linux API server comes in multiple methods:

	    1> Install the Linux API server in an XGS-SDL or XGS-HSL chassis. (Starting with 8.40)
	       - This is an all-in-one chassis solution.
               - XGS-SDL chassis supports 4 concurrent sessions.
	       - XGS-HSL chassis supports 10 concurrent sessions.

	    2> OVA or QCOW2 format installation for hypervisors (VMWare or KVM).


How to use ixnetCli.py
------------------------------------------
    - ixnetCli.py is the main module that you import in the Python Shell Interpreter.
    
    Example:

	 From a Linux or Windows OS prompt:

            Step 1:
	        Enter a Python shell:
		(If you are using Windows, you might have to enter the full path to your Python.exe) 
	           Enter: python  

            Step 2:
                Import the ixnetCli module
                   Enter: from ixnetCli import *

            Step 3:
                Enter: setpreferences('<preference file>')

	    Step 4:
	        Connect to the API server:
	    	   Enter: connecttolinux() or connecttowindows()

	    Step 5:
	        Create or load a saved config
                   To create. enter: config('<param file')
                   To load a saved config, enter: loadsavedconfig('ConfigFiles/<saved config file>')

	    Step 6:
	        Enter: starttraffic()

	    Step 7:
	        Enter: getstats()

	 - To see all the CLI commands
	      Enter: showcommands() or showcommands('The_fucntion_name')

	 - Docstring support:
	      Enter: help('The_function_name')

         - Useful functions:
              - showpreferencefiles()
              - showconfigfiles()
              - showtopologies()
              - showtrafficitems()
              - showallsessions()


Modify existing configurations, run traffic and get stats
-----------------------------------------------------------

    Once you are in the Python Shell, every CLI command is a
    Python syntax.
    
    Notes:

       - Modifying Traffic Item requires the Traffic Item's name as the first parameter.

       - To see all of your configured Traffic Item names, enter:
             showtrafficitemnames() or showtrafficitems()

       - To get a description of each parameter, enter: help(<the_function_name>)	 


    As of this version of the DOC, this application supports the following traffic modifications:

        - configcustompayload(trafficItemName customRepeat customPattern)

	    Enter: configcustompayload('Topo1 to Topo2', True, 'deadbeef')

	- flapbgp(topologyName bgpName enableTrueOrFalse ipInterfaceList upTimeInSeconds downTimeInSeconds))

	    Enter: flapbgp('Topo1 to Topo2', 'bgp1', True, 30, 10)

	- setfixedframes(trafficItemName)

	    Enter: setfixedframes('Topo1 to Topo2')

	- setframerate(trafficItemName frameRate)

	    Enter: setframerate('Topo1 to Topo2', 75)

	- setframecount(trafficItemName frameCount)

	    Enter: setframecount('Topo1 to Topo2', 15000)

	- setframesize(trafficItemName frameSize)

	    Enter: setframesize('Topo1 to Topo2', 128)

	- settrafficcontinuous(trafficItemName)

	    Enter: settrafficcontinuous('Topo1 to Topo2')

	After modifying your configurations, start traffic and get stats:

	    Enter: starttraffic()
	    Enter: getstats()


help()
------
    - All the CLI functions in the main module ixnetCli.py has a docstring description
      that descibes the function and all the parameters.
    
    - Use help(<CLI function name>) to see how to use the function and its parameters.

showcommands()
--------------
    - showcommands():  To view all the available CLI functions.
    - showcommands('<function name>'):  To view individual CLI functions.


For using Linux API server, which supports 10 concurrent sessions:

     - Each user should create their own preference file in the /Preferences directory.

     - Get the API-Key from the Linux API server in the Web UI and put it in your preference file.
          - On your web browser, enter the Linux API server IP address.
	  - Log in as admin/admin
	  - On top right corner, click on the settings icon
          - Go to My Account
	  - Click on Show API-Key.
 
     - If you haven't created a session ID, enter connecttolinux()

     - If you already have a session ID created, you could connect to it by entering:
            connecttolinux(resume=True, sessionId=<id>)

     - To delete a session Id, enter:
            - connecttolinux(resume=True, sessionId=<id>)
            - deletesession()

     - Once you are connected to a session Id, you could load different param files anytime you like
       to have a different configuration.
