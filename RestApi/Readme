Important:

The IxNetRestApi library in this level /IxNetwork/RestApi is deprecated in favor of using /IxNetwork/RestPy.
RestPy is superior and easier to automate.
It is a library that comes with all IxNetwork class objects for automation.
This means you don't have to request for any wrappers to perform any CRUDs. 
See RestPy sample scripts in https://github.com/openixia/IxNetwork/RestPy/SampleScripts.
loadConfigFile.py and bgpNgpf.py would be great starting points.

With tha said, the IxNetRestApi library is no longer maintained.
There will not be having new functions and enhancements.
