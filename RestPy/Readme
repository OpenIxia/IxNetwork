What is ixnetwork_restpy:
     - This is a client side script development tool that comes with the entire IxNetwork API tree in Python Classes.
     - Making this completely object oriented because there is a Python class for each node in IxNetwork API hierarchical tree.
     - At each node, say for example BGP, you could view its attributes during script development so
       you know how to create your configurations without having to view doc or the API browser.

Benefits:
     - This tool eliminates the need to create a function for each REST API.
     - All the Python classes you need are already generated.
     - This means you don't have to be creating and managing more API libraries containing high level wrappers.

Supports Python 2.7 and 3+

Requirement:
     - IxNetwork 8.50
     
Prerequisite:
     - Familiar with the IxNetwork API Browser first.
	
Where is the IxNetwork API Browser located:
     - In Windows GUI, make a simple configuration, go to Files, Tools, IxNetwork API Browser.
         - The left pane is the root level entry points to all the APIs in a hierarchical view of
	   your configuration.

     - For Linux, the IxNetwork API Browser is the default view.

     Notes:
         - There are two views: Widgets view and Table view.
         - The Widgets view is a graphical view like the IxNetwork GUI.
              - Allows viewing and modifying Topologies, Traffic Items and Statistics.
	      - Can start/stop protocols and traffic.

Installation: 
    You could either do a pip install or get it from Github:

    Pip install:
        - pip install -U --no-cache-dir ixnetwork_restpy
    
    Github:
        - Clone from: https://github.com/OpenIxia/IxNetwork
        - The tool is under https://github.com/OpenIxia/IxNetwork/RestApi/Python/RestPy/ixnetwork_restpy

        - Note: You need to include this path in your system's environment PYTHONPATH:
	        /your_path/IxNetwork/RestApi/Python/RestPy/ixnetwork_restpy

How to efficiently use ixnetwork_restpy:
    - Use the WebUI doc that comes with the PIP installation.
          - Located in your python site-packages/ixnetwork_restpy/docs/index.html
          - This doc shows and follows the IxNetwork API hierarchical tree model.
          - It is the same way you view the IxNetwork API Browser in Windows or Linux API server.
	  - To access the WebUI doc, on a web browser enter: 
               Linux:   file:///<path_to_your_python_installation>/site-packages/ixnetwork_restpy/docs/index.html
               Windows: file://c:/<path_to_your_python_installation>/site-packages/ixnetwork_restpy/docs/index.html

    - Use the IxNetwork API Browser as your guide to understand the API tree.
    - Look at the sample scripts and see how the object oriented dot notation correlates to the IxNetwork
      API tree and the WebUI doc.
